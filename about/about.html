        <p>
          My name is Raramainashe Wadaya, and I am a digital artist based in
          Johannesburg, South Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a keen interest in technology, but particularly in how humans
          interact and make meaning from their interactions with technology.
          Which is what informs my game and applications development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I began my journey into storytelling with film and photography. Making
          my first short film, A Fortunate Series of Events in 2019, which
          meanders philosophically around the death of young woman named Naledi.
          While admittedly, like any first attempt, not a strong film, it
          displays my inclination to contemplative and deep reaching narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shortly after the release of my short film I got into portrait
          photography, I find that the human subject is by far the most
          interesting and captivating for me to capture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most challenging form of storytelling I have encountered is in
          game design. While I enjoy coming up with narratives that focus on
          underrepresented and marginalised groups for my games, I quickly
          learnt that immersive storytelling, while highly rewarding, is no
          simple task.
        </p>
        <p>
          In creating these and other games I have gained an understanding of
          the complexity of interactive media, but this challenge is one I
          thoroughly enjoy and continue to step up to. This leads me to seek
          more and more immersive, interactive and challenging ways of telling
          the stories that grip my soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021 I had the privilege of being a part of the Retrospect
          Queerantine Exhibition, which was a digital exhibition exploring queer
          experiences during the pandemic. I partnered up with Mosibudi to tell
          the story of a queer student who has had to move back home from
          university to a space that is not welcoming of their queerness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am forever excited by innovations in technology and how they can be
          used to tell stories that resonate and help weaken the divisiveness
          and hatred that at times mars humanity, replacing it with empathy and
          understanding.
