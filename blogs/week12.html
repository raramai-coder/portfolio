      <p>Selected Reading – It’s not you. Bad doors are everywhere.</p>

      <h2>Norman Doors</h2>
      <p>
        The video uploaded by Vox follows the creator, Joe Posner, as he
        complains about a door at his office that he keeps using incorrectly and
        consequently hates. He speaks to other employees who say that the door
        also confuses them and that they have witnessed other people misuse the
        door as well. This leads him to contact Don Norman the man who wrote a
        book on the design of everyday things that specifically pointed out how
        doors are often terribly designed (Vox, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
        Norman states that it is not that people are stupid for pushing instead
        of pulling these doors, but that the doors themselves are designed
        poorly (Vox, 2016). The concept of discoverability proclaims that you
        should be able to look at an object and understand how its meant to be
        used (Vox, 2016). Now these doors will have handlebars on both sides
        instructing the user to grab onto them and intuitively the next logical
        step is to pull. But on one side this is not the case as the user is
        supposed to push. So, the door is giving the user misleading design
        signals (Brandall, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of poorly designed door is called a Norman Door, named after
        the man, but not by him to his amusement (Alexander, 2016). Its easy to
        spot a Norman Door, if you don’t know whether to push or pull a door,
        that’s a Norman Door (Morgan, 2018). If it needs instructions to tell
        you how to use it, that’s a Norman Door (Aguilera, 2016). And finally,
        if you and many other people struggle to use that door then it is most
        definitely a Norman Door (Vox, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because if you think about it, it should be immediately apparent how a
        door ought to be used (Morgan, 2018) and doors are not so complicated as
        to warrant an instruction on how to use them (Aguilera, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
        Don Norman expands in his book on how understanding the design of
        everyday things can be used to design better software products (Rekhi,
        2017). He states six principles for good design: visibility, feedback,
        constraints, mapping, consistency, and affordance. I will be analysing
        my website based on these six principles to critically engage with
        whether my UI design is acceptable.
      </p>

      <h2>The 6 Principles of Design</h2>

      <h3>Visibility</h3>
      <p>
        Lack of visibility means that decreases a user’s awareness of an element
        and with it the ability of that user to understand how to use and to use
        it well (Rekhi, 2017). This is why a lot of mobile apps have shifted
        from having hamburger menus to bottom navigation bars. Similarly in my
        own website my navigation pages were stored in a hamburger menu, this
        was bad for visibility and also extracted a lot more effort from the
        user in terms of constantly needing to open the hamburger in order to be
        able to find links to important pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I changed this to have the menu laid out horizontally in the
        navigation bar on top and only changing to hamburger menu when the
        screen width was too small.
      </p>

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>
        When a user takes an action, it should be immediately clear to them what
        has taken place and what consequences that action has had (Rekhi, 2017).
        I feel that the slideshow on the home page gives good feedback to the
        user on what has happened once they’ve scrolled their mouse. The image
        block goes white, drawing the user’s attention and awareness to the
        image and then the new images fades in. This way the user knows
        immediately that on scrolling the image being shown will change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also having the current page in the navigation bar have a pink
        background gives feedback to the user on which page they selected. When
        the user selects a page to navigate to, their eyes are on the navigation
        bar and when the new page loads their eyes are probably still on the
        navigation bar (granted the page loaded with a fast enough speed). So
        having the page they selected now have a pink background is immediate
        feedback to them that that is the page they have been navigated to.
      </p>

      <h3>Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        Limiting the range of possible interactions for elements simplifies the
        interface and helps user better understand and master how to use those
        elements (Rekhi, 2017). For majority of the elements on my website there
        is only one possible action for it either clicking or simply
        reading/viewing. So, on this measure my website fares well.
      </p>

      <h3>Mapping</h3>
      <p>
        There must be a clear relationship between controls and the effect they
        have (Rekhi, 2017). So, for example a stove plate where all the controls
        are aligned horizontally but the plates are in a grid has poor mapping,
        but one where the controls are also aligned in a grid with the matching
        control for a plate being in the same grid position has good mapping.
      </p>
      <p>
        The slideshow on the main page technically has poor mapping, because the
        images slide horizontally the scrolling motion on the mouse is a
        scrolling one. But this is overwritten by the fact that it is convention
        for slideshows or PowerPoints to move horizontally with mouse scrolling
        vertically. So, users have been conditioned to expect this behaviour and
        are thus able to use it.
      </p>

      <h3>Consistency</h3>
      <p>
        Similar operations and elements must be used for similar tasks (Rekhi,
        2017). I have tried to achieve consistency through the colour design of
        my website. On the site any element that is pink or one of its hues is a
        clickable element. All links for example are pink. And on the blog page,
        the blog cards have a white border, and when hovered over the background
        colour of the blog card changes to pink. Indicating to the user that is
        something that can be clicked on.
      </p>

      <h3>Affordance</h3>
      <p>
        Affordance is essentially a ‘hint’ provided by an object’s design that
        lets people know how to use it when they look at it (Rekhi, 2017 &
        Morgan, 2018). My biggest shortfall with the slideshow on the home page
        is that it has very weak affordance. Because the images slide on scroll
        there are not ‘next’ buttons on screen, and this means that to the user
        all they see on screen is an image. They might assume that the image is
        simply a static image with no real purpose aside from aesthetic. There
        is nothing on screen to indicate to them that they must scroll.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is something that I need to rectify by redesigning the page to show
        to the user that they have a slideshow of images they can scroll through
        instead of how it affords right now: as a static image on a webpage.
      </p>
