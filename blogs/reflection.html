    <h1>Critical Reflection of Work</h1>

    <article>
      <p>
        This reflection is split into two parts: reflection of the website
        development and reflection of my theoretical engagement of course
        content. For the reflection of my web development I used 7 key
        indicators of best practice in web development as laid out by
        www.visualobjects.com (Wess,2021).
      </p>

      <h2>Web Development</h2>
      <h3>Planning</h3>
      <p>
        It is important for a developer to program with an end goal in mind and
        a roadmap on how to get there in order to yield the best results
        (Wess,2021). Making the wireframes at the beginning of the semester
        really helped in giving me an end goal and a design vision that made
        sure that as I was working, I could stay focused. As I reflect, I am
        made into a religious proponent of making wireframes at the start of any
        development project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, I see how it saved me time as I was working because I no
        longer had to think about the creative or design elements of the website
        was structured because that was already done in the beginning. And even
        if I had new pages or features to add to the website that weren’t
        initially in the wireframes, I found that I had a guiding design vision
        that made it easy to be creative and to follow the vision to design the
        new pages or features as quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working in the order of how the lessons were structured really helped me
        with the process of development as a first-time web developer. Starting
        with the HTML then doing the CSS and finally adding JavaScript, this
        helped with me developing my understanding for how the web works on a
        technical level as well as working in a way that was reflexive of
        increasing levels of complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In future however I would much prefer to first get the skeleton of the
        website done using html and then working page by page to add the
        complete functionality (this means doing CSS and JavaScript at the same
        time) until that page is done. I prefer to work in increments of
        creating a Minimum Viable Product at the end of each increment. This
        keeps me motivated and makes me feel less overwhelmed because at the end
        of each increment I feel as though I have something tangible to show for
        my work and that goes a long way in helping me to not feel overwhelmed
        by how much work I still have to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also makes user testing much easier because now I can test the
        Minimum Viable Products I have created at each increment as I go and get
        a better understanding of how the user is interacting and experiencing
        my website.
      </p>

      <h3>Accesibility</h3>
      <p>
        I did not begin with accessibility (in terms of UI and UX) at the
        forefront of my mind when I first began designing and programming my
        website. It was only midway after the lectures for UI/UX were released
        that this became a consideration of mine. In future I would like to have
        accessibility as a consideration at the very beginning of the project.
        That way I don’t have to go back and make the website more accessible or
        add accessibility features, because it would have been accessible from
        the get-go.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to WebAIM Home page complexity has become an increasing
        problem in web development (WebAIM: The WebAIM Million – The 2022 report
        on the accessibility of the top 1,000,000 home pages, 2022). My home
        page is quite complex because of the scroll mechanism added. I realise
        that if a user does not have access to a mouse or their trackpad is not
        working as should be, the website will appear glitchy or even static to
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In future I would like to adjust the homepage to make it more accessible
        and give users an alternative way to move through the carousel.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also need to work on having alt text for my images. Since I am
        showcasing my work as a photographer, I find it of the utmost importance
        that all information about the images on my website is properly conveyed
        to the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do feel however that my use of semantic mark up has been good and
        helps with the accessibility of my website in terms of communicating
        with the browser and its crawlers. This is because of the fact that from
        the first html lesson there was emphasis put on proper semantic markup
        and so it was always at the front of my mind throughout development.
      </p>

      <h3>User Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I wish I had gotten user testing data in order to be able to more
        accurately reflect on the user experience of my website. Because I can
        say I feel that the website has good user experience but that is clouded
        by the fact that as the designer and developer of the website I know how
        I want the website to be used and what I want to communicate so to me it
        is clear. But the real measure comes from whether someone who is
        engaging with the website for the first time is able to understand what
        I am trying to communicate and engage with the website how I intended.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another issue is that because it was my first-time doing web development
        I focused and programming features and functionality. But in future, now
        that I have the experience and an idea of how to accomplish things in
        web development, I would like to more critically and actively think
        about how the user will interact with my webpages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially the ‘story’ of each webpage, where I want the interaction to
        begin and how it must flow. Making conscious the intention of how I want
        the user to interact with my webpages. This way it’s not by mistake that
        the thing that grabs my user’s attention is the heading instead of the
        image below it, but that that has a purpose and a reason behind it.
      </p>

      <h3>Conventions</h3>
      <p>
        For the most part I feel that I followed conventions and was not too
        experimental with my design. And I began wireframing from other
        portfolio websites that I catalogued and studied. So this helped me
        stick to convention and not deviate too much from standards.
      </p>

      <h3>Code Conciseness and Usefulness</h3>
      <p>
        I kept my code concise by only writing code for html and CSS that was
        necessary for the functionality I wanted to implement. In terms of
        JavaScript, I was conscious to not have any repeated lines of code that
        could simply be put into a function. The only time I had to repeated
        lines of code was for the two navigation functions because I realised
        that GitHub pages only works with relative linking and that my
        navigation function needed to be adjusted for whether or not a page was
        inside a different folder relative to the page it was trying to navigate
        to.
      </p>

      <h3>Compatibility Across Multiple Devices</h3>
      <p>
        I did not wireframe for mobile version of my website, and it was not
        consciously programmed for as I developed. For example, the programming
        for the mediaquery of what to when the webpage is resized to be smaller
        in width would help with how users experience the website on mobile, but
        this was done with webpages on a computer in mind and only
        coincidentally works for mobile as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing as how mobile users are rapidly increasing and projected to
        increase across the globe (Smartphone users 2026 | Statista, 2022), it
        is of the utmost importance that I design and program with these users
        in mind as well. Going forward I would like to work on actively
        designing the app for the mobile user experience.
      </p>

      <h3>Mixing HTML with CSS or JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        separate files instead of coding those functions in the html files. I
        feel this makes my code more legible and easier to collaborate with
        other programmers.
      </p>

      <h2>Theoretical</h2>
      <p>
        In the beginning I found that I approached the critical writings in a
        more informal way, so I did not reference properly and do my citations.
        But now I understand that that is something I need to do and include in
        my writings.
      </p>
      <p>
        My own research was also something I did not do in the beginning, but I
        understand the value of getting information from other sources and being
        able to link that to the reading. It shows a cognitive process of
        understanding that is deeper than simply knowing what the author was
        trying to say but also being able to contextualise in the broader field
        of understanding that exists outside of that single source.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another element of deeper understanding is being able to bring my own
        voice to the topics while there are writings where I feel I did this
        well, I also know that I struggled to do this with readings that I did
        not find particularly interesting or engaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I found that understanding the concepts expressed in the readings
        was not an issue for me, but making and conveying the depth of this
        understanding through the cognitive processes of linking and criticality
        of own voice are what I need to work on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, I personally feel as though I gained a lot through the
        theoretical component of this course, but I did not sit with this theory
        and apply it to how I designed and developed my website, again owing to
        the fact that I was a beginner and was focused on making functionality
        work. But going forward I would like my design to reflect my decolonial
        ideas and intentions and to actively work to combat the problems of the
        web discussed in this course.
      </p>

      <h2>Self-Assesment</h2>
      <p>
        The self-assessment was quite difficult for me. I found that it was hard
        to calibrate my performance and give it a mark. Not because I am unable
        to be critical of my own work (this is something I am quite comfortable
        with) but because I was subconsciously not simply being critical of my
        work but trying gauge how the marker would view my work and then basing
        my marks on that.
      </p>
      <p>
        This of course wad not a lovely experience and I struggle to see how in
        future I might be able to do it without subconsciously feeling like I am
        getting marked for how well I can guess the marker will feel about my
        work. I will of course try to shift from this mindset best as I can to
        one that is more focused on self-reflection that I way I can extract
        more value from the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, I feel my imposter syndrome really shines through in the
        self-assessment because there are parts where I feel I might have been
        to harsh on myself and not realised the true value of the work I did.
