    <article class="h-entry">
      <p>
        In 2011 Marc Andreesen penned an influential paper for the Wall Street
        Journal, titled: ‘Software is Eating the world’. (Francisco, 2021) At
        the time of writing the stock market disfavoured tech companies, with
        them being some of the lowest valued companies at the time, (Andreessen,
        2011) something so absurd to think about in 2022 when they are the kinds
        of companies whose value actually grew throughout the worldwide pandemic
        when many industries saw a decline in business. But still at a time like
        this, when many investors though that these new tech companies were
        fads, he proclaimed that they were going to take over ‘large swathes of
        the economy’. (Andreessen, 2011)
      </p>
      <p>
        And with hindsight he was absolutely correct, many industries have been
        disrupted and overtaken by software companies. To the point that
        industry in general has started to take on a more ‘software company’
        outlook on business strategy. With the total amount of money spent on
        enterprise software in 2022 expected to be over $250 billion. (Torres,
        2021)
      </p>
      <p>
        Companies are looking into how they can make their everyday operations
        more automated, and how they can offer their services to their customers
        using software, with the hope of not being overtaken by a software-based
        company as Uber did to meter taxis or Amazon to bookstores. It is cliché
        to say that ‘every company needs to be a software company’ in today’s
        age. (Patel, 2016) For that is simply the reality of it: software has
        eaten the world.
      </p>
      <h3>Software Has Eaten the World- Now What?</h3>
      <p>
        Now that software is everywhere and unavoidable part of doing business
        no matter the industry there are important implications to consider,
        moral and ethical implications. Software Engineers often look at the
        software’s they create as simply products, the end. But that is
        complicated by the fact that these products through human interaction
        can result in dire consequences arising, as dire as genocides.
        (Cantrill, 2019)
      </p>
      <p>
        In his talk at CraftCon-2019 Bryan Cantril offers a compelling argument
        for more moral and ethical questions to be considered, even ingrained
        into software development culture. He does so by giving a few examples
        of softwares that were programmed (albeit without the intentions to be
        morally objectionable) that had terrible ethical ramifications. Stand
        out examples include Google’s photo tagging AI that tagged dark-skinned
        people as gorillas, Tesla’s driver assist software marketed as autopilot
        leading to the death of a few drivers, Facebook being used to instigate,
        plan and disseminate Anti-Rohingya violence and Joyent hosting Gab which
        was a platform that emboldened the Pittsburgh shooter. (Cantrill, 2019)
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these examples with their differing levels of horror have one
        thing in common: the question of responsibility. Is Facebook responsible
        for users spreading violent rhetoric that would lead to the deaths of
        many? Some would argue no, Facebook is just the transmitter, whilst
        others would argue that Facebook has not only the responsibility but
        also the capabilities to monitor the content that is disseminated on
        their platform. (Cantrill, 2019)
      </p>
      <p>
        Cantrill does an excellent job on emphasizing that the point is not to
        have the right answers, but to build a culture that is asking the right
        questions. The more we ask these types of questions the closer we get to
        creating software that has fewer ethical dilemmas.
      </p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        In reflection this talk and the research I did afterwards has cemented
        in my mind the power that software developers have in the modern world.
        And to quote Uncle Ben: with great power comes great responsibility.
        Software Developers have a greater burden to society than ever before.
        So it is not enough for us to simply make products we have to think
        critically and ask tough moral and ethical questions about the softwares
        we create.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have to build a culture of constant ethical curiosity over the
        products we make and their resulting impact on the humans who will
        interact with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which is why I think this course is so important and has taken a good
        route in not only focusing on the technical aspects of web development
        but delving into critical and ethical thinking surrounding development
        for the web.
