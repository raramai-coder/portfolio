      <h1 class="p-name">The Medium is The Message</h1>
      <p>
        In this piece McLuhan makes the assertion that when it comes to the social
        message, the medium is the message. It is more important to understand the
        effects of the medium itself on human interaction and existence than to
        understand its contents in order to understand how this medium shapes
        human society.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ‘social message’ cannot be separated from the medium itself. By
        amplifying existing human processes, the medium causes a disruption or
        enhancement of our interactions, affecting our social and psychological
        spheres. This disruption is independent of the content of the medium, it
        happens regardless.
      </p>

        An example he gives is that of electric light and power, which I feel can
        also be extended to the internet. You see these mediums eliminate the
        limitations of time and space and facilitate certain kinds of human
        interaction. I can read a tweet at 3 am written by someone in Brazil 6
        years ago. I am getting access to their thoughts without the barrier of
        time and space, surely that has an affect on my psyche and my relation to
        humanity that is independent of the contents of that specific tweet. It is
        not the kinds of stories that print media published that was so important
        for that historic moment but rather how print media’s existence changed
        human stories, the way we interact, and the social formations that arose
        from it. He calls this ‘the action of media’. And states that there is no
        medium that does not act and create a social message.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The effects of technology do not occur at the level of opinions or
        concepts, but alter sense ratios or patterns of perception steadily and
        without any resistance” (McLuhan, 1964:5) This quote summarises his main
        argument in expressing that an understanding of how any medium has
        affected a society must go beyond its contents. And I strongly agree with
        him for the most part. Where I disagree with is the extent to which he
        disregards the contents of a medium going so far as to call it ineffectual
        in creating a social message. I feel that the medium as well as the
        content create a social message, and the role of the medium has long been
        downplayed but the remedy to this ignorance is not in downplaying the
        contents either. The solution is when studying art to not only look at the
        content but the medium as well, with equal intensity.

      <p style="padding-bottom: 25px">
        He makes the example of how people would ask ‘what’s the painting about?’
        and not ‘what’s the house about?’ drawing on this comparison to imply that
        asking what a painting is about is as silly as asking what a house is
        about. But this ignores the fact that paintings as a medium are used to
        convey ideas, concepts or messages, whilst houses are not. He ignores the
        fact that mediums have different uses and values in society that dictates
        how we interact with them and in turn how they shape us. A film has
        stronger powers for communicating ideas of masculinity than a house does.
        Even in the example he makes of Napoleon stating that three hostile
        newspapers are more dangerous than a thousand bayonets. But it is not the
        newspapers that Napoleon is afraid of, it is hostile newspapers,
        emphasizing that the content is of great importance.
