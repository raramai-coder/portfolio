    <h1 class="p-name">What is Semantic Markup</h1>
    <article class="h-entry">
      <p>
        Semantic Markup is writing HTML in such a way that the semantic meaning
        of content is prioritised over the appearance (Semantic HTML for
        Meaningful Webpages, 2017). Previously, HTML tags were chosen based on
        how they would appear in the browser, for example an h1 or h2 tag might
        be chosen because of its sizing and appearance. But now it is best to
        choose an h1 or h2 tag based on priority and hierarchy, and then do the
        styling in CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially separating the appearance from the structure in code
        (Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages, 2017). Ensuring that CSS is used
        for styling only and html for structure only. And using tags in such a
        way that they convey some sort of information about what kinds of data
        are enclosed within them (Penland,2022).
      </p>
      <p>
        Semantic Markup takes into consideration how both humans and machine
        will interact with the information on the page. Helping developers,
        browsers, web crawlers and other devices distinguish between different
        kinds of information and its importance (Semantic HTML for Meaningful
        Webpages, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
        Semantic elements clearly define the content encapsulated for example
        &lt;form&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;etc. Unlike non-semantic
        elements such as &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; that give no clue as to
        the kind of information contained in them. It is highly encouraged to be
        as semantic as possible (Penland,2022).
      </p>
      <h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
      <p>There are three main reasons why semantic markup is important:</p>
      <h3>1.SEO</h3>
      <p>
        Search engines weigh keywords and make rankings based on the kind of
        information presented, and its importance based on hierarchy (Semantic
        HTML for Meaningful Webpages, 2017). A keyword in an &lt;h1&gt; tag is
        ranked higher than one in a &lt;p&gt; tag, in terms of the web browser
        deciding what is the most relevant and meaningful information on the
        webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Semantics helps to define all of that to the search engine. Successfully
        writing your HTML as semantic as possible will lead to your webpage
        being ranked favourably. This is important because without good SEO,
        your valuable content will not reach its intended audience (Semantic
        HTML for Meaningful Webpages, 2017).
      </p>
      <h3>2.Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        Using proper semantic markup ensures that accessibility design is not an
        afterthought but a core design element (Semantic HTML for Meaningful
        Webpages, 2017). And this is of great importance as there are over 1
        billion people in the world who are differently abled (Semantic HTML for
        Meaningful Webpages, 2017). So, it is important that we ensure equal
        access for them instead of access that makes them feel like second-class
        users.
      </p>
      <p>
        People who are differently abled will be able to experience your webpage
        efficiently, through the use of assisting tools if your page is marked
        up correctly. They can customize their experience to best suit them and
        have their tools present your webpage to them in the way that was
        intended.
      </p>
      <h3>3.Maintenance</h3>
      <p>
        Code that is semantic is clean and much easier to read, so this makes it
        easy to maintain and easy to collaborate on. Future collaborators will
        also find it easy to understand (since semantic code is clear and
        standardized) and hence adjust and maintain the code (Semantic HTML for
        Meaningful Webpages, 2017). Appearance is also much easier to customize,
        modify and update through CSS when semantic markup is used. Customising
        the semantic elements becomes much more efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, decoupling the structure of an element from its appearance
        means that it is easier to update and change. The appearance of an
        element can be changed or updated without altering its structure
        (Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages, 2017). And you can apply the
        same styling to multiple different elements, which allows for efficient
        code reusability.
