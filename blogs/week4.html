    <h1 class="p-name">What is Semantic Markup</h1>
    <article class="h-entry">
      <p>
        Semantic Markup is writing HTML in such a way that the semantic meaning
        of content is prioritised over the appearance. Previously, HTML tags
        were chosen based on how they would appear in the browser, for example
        an h1 or h2 tag might be chosen because of its sizing and appearance.
        But now it is best to choose an h1 or h2 tag based on priority and
        hierarchy, and then do the styling in CSS. Essentially separating the
        appearance from the structure in code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Semantic Markup takes into consideration how both humans and machine
        will interact with the information on the page. Helping developers,
        browsers, web crawlers and other devices distinguish between different
        kinds of information and its importance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Semantic elements clearly define the content encapsulated for example
        &lt;form&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;etc. Unlike non-semantic
        elements such as &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; that give no clue as to
        the kind of information contained in them. It is highly encouraged to be
        as semantic as possible.
      </p>
      <h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
      <p>There are three main reasons why semantic markup is important:</p>
      <h3>1.SEO</h3>
      <p>
        Search engines weigh keywords and make rankings based on the kind of
        information presented, its importance based on hierarchy. Semantics
        helps to define all of that to the search engine. Successfully writing
        your HTML as semantic as possible will lead to your webpage being ranked
        favourably.
      </p>
      <h3>2.Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        People who are differently abled will be able to experience your webpage
        efficiently, through the use of assisting tools if your page is marked
        up correctly. They can customize their experience to best suit them and
        have their tools present your webpage to them in the way that was
        intended.
      </p>
      <h3>3.Maintenance</h3>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 25px">
        Code that is semantic is clean and much easier to read, so this makes it
        easy to maintain and easy to collaborate on. Future collaborators will
        also find it easy to understand and hence adjust and maintain the code.
        Appearance is also much easier to customize, modify and update through
        CSS when semantic markup is used. Customising the semantic elements
        becomes much more efficient.
