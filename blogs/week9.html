    <h1>Information Geographies</h1>
    <article>
      <p>
        Paper: Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable
        augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information – Graham
        et al.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper states that information has always had geography, owing to the
        fact that it arises out of physical material places. Information is also
        about movement and having this information move from place to place
        (Graham et al, 2015).
      </p>
        <p>
          Now when it comes to places in the real-world, geographic augmentation refers to information about places (such as stories, experiences, and other data) associated with those places. This is also referred to as data shadows: layers of digital information about a particular place (Graham & Dutton, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
          Augmenting the material places with other information necessarily shapes it instead of simply describing it. This geographic information itself has many political implications that are tied to historic webs of power and information production (Graham et al, 2015).  Furthermore, this information affects not only how we think and know about these places but also dictates the ways we enact and produce cultural practices in these places (Graham & Dutton, 2014). An example of this is tourism, if a person does not have any knowledge about the tourism possibilities and attractions of place, they are very unlikely to visit that place. Highlighting how information geographies also have economic consequences on wealth, trade and consumer behaviour (Greenstein et al,2018).
        </p>
        <p>
          Because information has always been mobile, the authors define ‘immutable mobiles’ as information that can be transported from one place to another without much change to its content or core meaning (Graham et al, 2015). For example, printing made it possible to transport information in the immutable form of the book. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, immutable information about a place could now also be transported to other places adding informational augmentations to that place in the immutable form of printed paper (Graham et al, 2015).  Forming most people’s knowledge about those places through these information geographies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the internet, the power to form informational augmentations was held by a few people with the access to resources, knowledge and power to do so.  Institutions with these three things monopolised the creation of information geographies (Graham et al, 2015).   And the distribution of these three was uneven
        </p>
        <p>
          Now in the age of the internet many people are hopeful that access will be more even, and information geographies will have, not only in their creation but in their representation as well, a more egalitarian form. With many presenting the internet as a solution to complex social problems of access and representation (Magenya, 2020).
        </p>

      <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        To measure whether access has become more egalitarian, the authors looked at three things: geographies of access and enablement, geographies of participation, and geographies of representation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding geographies of access and enablement they were looking to see if people had access to the technologies and requirements in order to participate in information geographies. And they found that 3 billion people across the world had access to the internet, which is a huge and positive number, with Asia holding the world’s largest internet population. However, most people on our planet remain without good access and low incomes play a huge role in this (Graham et al, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then with geographies of participation they looked at domain names, Wikipedia edits and github contributions to see the trends on who was participating in creating information geographies. They found that Western Europe and North America were the most represented in terms of participation on the web compared to other places in the world who were sorely lagging behind (Graham et al, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally for geographies of representation they sought to see if people were playing a large role in creating the (im)mutable augmentations of the places they live in. They measured Google searches, nodes on OpenStreet Map and the Semantic Web. Their measurements found that the global south was staggering behind when it came to adding information about their places onto the web (Graham et al, 2015). 
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper concludes that there is vast unevenness regarding informational geographies, and this imbalance reflects historical power imbalances. The authors feel that the paper raises more questions than it answers, questions such as the impacts of post-colonial modes of governing and producing information, the ways in which political power affects information geographies and finally how we can bring about more egalitarian and just information geographies (Graham et al, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
        Having stated all the above the authors assert that the paper should be seen as a starting point for further research. 
      </p>

      <h2> Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I feel that the methodology taken by the authors to come to their conclusions is sound and done well for what they set out to do. Given that years have passed since the release of this paper it is obvious that there would be more to measure in the modern day, for example seeing where different social media posts about places come from which users located in which places, as social media now plays an even bigger role in information geographies. Or measuring where ads on social media are created from, to see which places play a larger hand in advertising to the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of April 2022, 63% of the world has access to the internet, with Northern Europe leading by having 98% of its population with access to the internet (Johnson, 2022). This increase in internet users is a positive thing but it is worth mentioning that this increase is mostly from Asian and South American countries, with many African countries still having way less than 45 million internet users in their countries (Individuals using the Internet (% of population) | Data, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, there are over 4.65 billion social media users worldwide (Johnson, 2022), showing the importance and relevancy of social media in studying information geographies. Notably the top ranked social media sites (based on number of users) mostly originated from the United States (Dixon, 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
        These more recent statistics show a continuation that is not very different from what the authors found in regard to access and creation trends favouring the global North over the Global South. This further emphasizes that the authors did well in their aim to create a starting point for further research on information geographies. And for its time the research was adequately done and serves well as a starting point.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also worth noting the great importance that research on information geographies has in our society. Particularly in regard to “knowledge dependence” (Graham & Dutton, 2014), when majority of the world’s information production is taking place in the West, this leaves the rest of the world dependent on their knowledge systems and pedagogy’s. Making it even harder for colonised peoples to not only decolonize their ways of thinking and knowledge systems, but on a global scale it makes it almost impossible to decentre the West in terms of information and knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is said that maps reinforce and legitimise the status quo without our awareness (Graham & Dutton, 2014), in a similar way I assert that information geographies reinforce and assert colonial systems of power and oppression.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of this is when profound feminist author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, said that the characters she wrote were white and did not reflect her realities as a Nigerian woman (Graham & Dutton, 2014).  She was in the global South creating information that still centred the global North. So simply giving her access to the means of information production did not deal with the inequalities of knowledge production. A lot more work had to be done. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, we need to study and understand the inequalities of information geographies instead hailing it and other technologies) as the thing that will equalize the playing fields (Magenya, 2020). We must become aware of how the internet is mirroring the historical and material power systems of oppression if we mean to truly combat that.
