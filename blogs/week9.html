    <h1>Information Geographies</h1>
    <article>
      <p>
        Paper: Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable
        augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information – Graham
        et al.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper states that information has always had geography, owing to the
        fact that it arises out of physical material places. Information is also
        about movement and having this information move from place to place
        (Graham et al, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now when it comes to places in the real-world, geographic augmentation
        refers to information about places (such as stories, experiences, and
        other data) associated with those places. Augmenting it with other
        information that necessarily shapes it instead of simply describing it.
        This geographic information itself has many political implications that
        are tied to historic webs of power and information production (Graham et
        al, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because information has always been mobile, the authors define
        ‘immutable mobiles’ as information that can be transported from one
        place to another without much change to its content or core meaning
        (Graham et al, 2015). For example, printing made it possible to
        transport information in the immutable form of the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, immutable information about a place could now also be
        transported to other places adding informational augmentations to that
        place in the immutable form of printed paper (Graham et al, 2015).
        Forming most people’s knowledge about those places through these
        information geographies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the internet, the power to form informational augmentations was
        held by a few people with the access to resources, knowledge and power
        to do so. Institutions with these three things monopolised the creation
        of information geographies (Graham et al, 2015). And the distribution of
        these three was uneven.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now in the age of the internet many people are hopeful that access will
        be more even, and information geographies will have, not only in their
        creation but in their representation as well, a more egalitarian form.
      </p>

      <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        To measure whether access has become more egalitarian, the authors
        looked at three things: geographies of access and enablement,
        geographies of participation, and geographies of representation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding geographies of access and enablement they were looking to see
        if people had access to the technologies and requirements in order to
        participate in information geographies. And they found that 3 billion
        people across the world had access to the internet, which is a huge and
        positive number, with Asia holding the world’s largest internet
        population. However, most people on our planet remain without good
        access and low incomes play a huge role in this (Graham et al, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then with geographies of participation they looked at domain names,
        Wikipedia edits and github contributions to see the trends on who was
        participating in creating information geographies. They found that
        Western Europe and North America were the most represented in terms of
        participation on the web compared to other places in the world who were
        sorely lagging behind (Graham et al, 2015).
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally for geographies of representation they sought to see if people
        were playing a large role in creating the (im)mutable augmentations of
        the places they live in. They measured Google searches, nodes on
        OpenStreet Map and the Semantic Web. Their measurements found that the
        global south was staggering behind when it came to adding information
        about their places onto the web (Graham et al, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper concludes that there is vast unevenness in regard to the
        informational geographies, and this imbalance reflects historical power
        imbalances. The authors feel that the paper raises more questions than
        it answers and should be seen as a starting point for further research.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I feel that the methodology taken by the authors to come to their
        conclusions is sound and done well for what they set out to do. Given
        that years have passed since the release of this paper it is obvious
        that there would be more to measure in the modern day, for example
        seeing where different social media posts about places come from which
        users located in which places, as social media now plays an even bigger
        role in information geographies. Or measuring where ads on social media
        are created from, to see which places play a larger hand in advertising
        to the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of April 2022, 63% of the world has access to the internet, with
        Northern Europe leading by having 98% of its population with access to
        the internet (Johnson, 2022). This increase in internet users is a
        positive thing but it is worth mentioning that this increase is mostly
        from Asian and South American countries, with many African countries
        still having way less than 45 million internet users in their countries
        (Individuals using the Internet (% of population) | Data, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, there are over 4.65 billion social media users worldwide
        (Johnson, 2022), showing the importance and relevancy of social media in
        studying information geographies. Notably the top ranked social media
        sites (based on number of users) mostly originated from the United
        States (Dixon, 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
        These more recent statistics show a continuation that is not very
        different from what the authors found with access and creation trends
        favouring the global North over the Global South. This further
        emphasizes that the authors did well in their aim to create a starting
        point for further research on information geographies. And for its time
        the research was adequately done and serves well as a starting point.
