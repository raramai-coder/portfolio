    <h1 class="p-name" >Mini Essay</h1>

    <article class="h-entry">
        <p>
            In this mini essay I will be reflecting on themes and concepts dealt with in this course that stood out to me and have changed my perception of software development. I will also be adding new thought process and making connections that I see between the different topics covered in this course.
        </p>

        <h2>Goodness! The Medium really was the Message all along.</h2>
        <p>
            At the beginning of this course, we did Marshall McLuhan’s piece on the medium being the message. Of course, at the time this was a new idea to me and while I accepted that there were a lot of truths he was peddling, it did not quite sink in just how profound what he was stating was. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is very important that we recognise that the medium comes with a message and that we are aware of this every time we use the medium to avoid unconsciously reinforcing oppressive elements of the status quo in our use and distribution of the medium. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A good example of this is maps, maps can reinforce systems of power without our being aware (Graham & Dutton, 2014), in the way that they draw and legitimise boundaries created by colonial powers in the most dehumanising ways. Each time a map is shared and distributed this act of creating, sectioning, and categorising people of colour against their will is legitimised and normalised. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So, it is not just about where the line on the map is drawn or what colour ink is used (the content) but the very existence of the map itself (the medium) that contributes to the meaning. And this meaning of course upholds the colonial status quo without loudly shouting that it is doing so. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now when it comes to software products and the internet it necessarily holds that the medium is the message. But it is not enough to simply proclaim that, we must ask “well then, what is this message?” 
        </p>

        <h2>What is the Internet’s Message?</h2>
        <p>
            Of course, there is no singular message of the internet as a medium as that would be an oversimplification of how humans interact with the internet and how it in turn shapes us. I will therefore be looking at this question from the lens of exclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The internet as a medium excludes certain users in its structure. The most obvious and glaring one is language, there are many languages for which browsing on the internet fully is practically impossible. Furthermore, majority of the internet’s content and applications are come from western countries (Graham & Dutton, 2014), meaning that the considerations and cultural practices of the west are intimately intertwined with these software products.  
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of this is submission forms for names that don’t accept less that three characters as a valid input. This restriction makes sense in western context where most names are longer than three characters, but this does not apply to for example Asian names where names can be two characters long. This is what I mean by the software products coming out of a western context and being intertwined with that context.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, because non-western peoples are not considered in the creation of these softwares they are implicitly excluded from it. This has dire consequences for non-westerners who have to use software products that use conventions, languages and systems that exclude them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So regardless of the content of the webpage or web application, a message has been sent to the non-western user, that reinforces colonial ideals of exclusion.
        </p>

        <h2>Wait Until Mr McLuhan hears about Semantic Markup</h2>
        <p>
            But this doesn’t have to be the message of the internet. There are of course many ways to make the internet more inclusive and to decentre it from western view, with a lot of these ways having to be solutions outside of the real world that combat socio-economic and political problems in the real world (Magenya, 2020). 
        </p>
        <p>
            For software developers however, one way we can change the message of the internet as a medium is through semantic markup. Proper semantic markup represents an act of balancing the importance put on the content as well as on the medium. The user doesn’t see the source code and won’t know about how it was written, but semantic markup still affects their experience of the content. Users using screen readers will have a much better experience of a webpage that has the proper semantic markup to help the screen reader present the content as best as possible to the user. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This alone means that they won’t have to experience the feeling of being excluded and having to feel like second-grade consumers who weren’t considered in the creation process. As a young black woman who grew up watching television filled predominantly with white characters in western contexts, I understand intimately the subconscious pain and effects of exclusion.   
        </p>
        <p>
            It is like you’re always being told “this was not made for you; you don’t belong here” every time you interact with an exclusionary piece of media. This in turn affects your participation in that space and your contributions to it. But this does not have to be the case for differently abled users trying to use the internet. And the solution is a lot more straightforward than trying to solve the other problems of the internet: proper semantic markup. 
        </p>

        <h2>Information Geographies can map the way forward</h2>
        <p>
            Studying information geographies really helps to contextualise and see how the internet, despite being hailed as the equalising cure-all for society’s problems (Magenya, 2020), is in fact just mirroring existing systems of oppression. Having this understanding can help to erase the false notion of the internet’s neutrality as a medium. Again, as stated earlier, the medium is the message, and the internet definitely has a message; one that is rooted in western culture and systems. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Without engaging in these studies, the unbalanced information geographies, we see across the internet will continue to exist uncontested. And if we truly want to decolonise the internet experience for many users and make it inclusive, we must find ways to decentre the west. And this begins with an analysis of the medium. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To reiterate, this is a complex problem whose solution unfortunately cannot be simply dealt out in a mini essay. But the goal is for us as software developers is to enter a culture and a space of consistently analysing and engaging with these geographies. And working from a space of intentionally wanting to make the internet accessible for all. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And access, beyond just the ability to be able to interact fully with a product, is also about inhabitation. It is about being able to inhabit a space so wholly that it feels like home (Mbembe, 2015). Such that you do not feel like a foreigner, an intruder, or an after-thought in that space. And for users to have this experience it means including their languages, their cultural and religious practices and their localities in the software products they use.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will take a lot of work, but in my humble opinion, it is a worthwhile pursuit.   
        </p>

        <h2>The Effects of the Course</h2>
        <p>
            To conclude I would like to map out my personal journey with the course. I found the course to be very valuable to my pursuit of knowledge as a software developer. Not only did I acquire the technical skills required for me to build a website. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But I also got to engage with theoretical aspects that have invisible but profound effects on the software products I create as well as the user’s experience of them. This will forever alter my development practices as well as the thought processes I follow when creating software products for the better.
